# AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This resource is designed for students with prior AI knowledge who want to apply these concepts to robotics, as well as educators and professionals in the field.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems. It encompasses the principles and practices of creating intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world through robotics, sensors, and actuators.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized around four core modules:

1. **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System for distributed robotics applications
2. **Gazebo & Unity**: Simulation environments for robot development and testing
3. **NVIDIA Isaac**: GPU-accelerated robotics platform for AI-powered robots
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: Next-generation multimodal models for robotics

## Learning Approach

The content is structured to build from foundational concepts to advanced applications, with practical examples, code snippets, and interactive elements throughout. Each module includes:

- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementation examples
- URDF snippets for robot configuration
- Assessment exercises
- Learning outcomes

## Target Audience

- Students with prior AI knowledge looking to apply it to robotics
- Educators teaching robotics and AI courses
- Professionals working in robotics and AI fields

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes familiarity with:
- Basic AI and machine learning concepts
- Programming experience (Python preferred)
- Fundamentals of robotics (kinematics, dynamics)

## Getting Started

Begin with the first module on ROS 2 to establish a foundation for distributed robotics applications, then progress through the other modules in sequence or focus on areas most relevant to your interests.
