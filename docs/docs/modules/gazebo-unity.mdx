# Gazebo & Unity Module

## Introduction to Simulation Environments
Simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity are crucial for developing and testing robotics applications before deploying to real hardware. This module covers both physics-based simulation in Gazebo and game engine-based simulation in Unity.

## Gazebo Simulation
Gazebo provides realistic physics simulation and rendering capabilities for robotics applications. Key features include:
- Physics engine with accurate collision detection
- Sensor simulation (cameras, lidar, IMU, etc.)
- Plugin system for custom functionality

## Unity Simulation
Unity offers a powerful game engine approach to robotics simulation with:
- High-quality graphics rendering
- Flexible physics system
- Asset creation and management tools

## Practical Examples
This module includes URDF examples and simulation configurations:

```xml
<!-- Example URDF robot definition -->
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<robot name="simple_robot">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.5 0.5 0.5"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.5 0.5 0.5"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
  </link>

  <joint name="base_to_wheel" type="continuous">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="wheel_link"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 -0.25" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
  </joint>

  <link name="wheel_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.15" length="0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>
</robot>
```

## Learning Outcomes
