# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models Module

## Introduction to VLA Models
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a new paradigm in robotics where vision, language understanding, and action generation are unified in a single model. This module covers the principles and applications of VLA models in robotics.

## Key Concepts
- Multimodal learning (vision + language + action)
- End-to-end learning from human demonstrations
- Generalization across tasks and environments
- Foundation models for robotics

## Practical Examples
This module includes examples of VLA model integration:

```python
# Example VLA model interaction (conceptual)
import numpy as np
import torch

class VLAModel:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        # Load pre-trained VLA model
        self.model = self.load_model(model_path)

    def predict_action(self, image, instruction):
        """
        Predict action based on visual input and natural language instruction
        """
        # Process visual input
        visual_features = self.extract_visual_features(image)

        # Process language instruction
        language_features = self.encode_language(instruction)

        # Combine modalities and predict action
        action = self.model(visual_features, language_features)

        return action

    def execute_task(self, image, instruction):
        """
        Execute a task based on visual input and natural language instruction
        """
        action = self.predict_action(image, instruction)

        # Convert action to robot command
        robot_command = self.action_to_command(action)

        return robot_command

    def load_model(self, path):
        # Placeholder for model loading
        pass

    def extract_visual_features(self, image):
        # Placeholder for visual feature extraction
        pass

    def encode_language(self, text):
        # Placeholder for language encoding
        pass

    def action_to_command(self, action):
        # Placeholder for converting action to robot command
        pass

# Example usage
def main():
    vla_model = VLAModel("path/to/pretrained/model")

    # Example instruction
    instruction = "Pick up the red block and place it on the blue surface"

    # Example image (would come from robot's camera)
    image = np.random.random((224, 224, 3))  # Placeholder

    # Execute the task
    command = vla_model.execute_task(image, instruction)

    print(f"Robot command: {command}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
