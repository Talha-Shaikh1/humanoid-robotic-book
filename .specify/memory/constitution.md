# AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Excellence
Educational excellence through accurate, comprehensive coverage of course modules. All content must be technically accurate, pedagogically sound, and aligned with the course curriculum. Content must be based on provided course details including modules, weekly breakdown, and hardware requirements.

### Interactivity and Usability
Interactivity and usability for learners with varying backgrounds. The platform must be designed to accommodate different skill levels, provide interactive elements, and use MDX format for Docusaurus pages with code examples, diagrams, and interactive elements to enhance learning experience.

### AI Integration
Integration of AI tools for spec-driven development. The system must leverage AI tools effectively, including RAG chatbot capabilities that handle general queries and selected text accurately, following Spec-Kit Plus methodology for spec-driven generation.

### Modularity
Modularity to incorporate bonus features seamlessly. The architecture must support modular design to easily integrate bonus implementations such as authentication with background questions, chapter personalization based on user data, and Urdu translation using AI.

### Code Quality Standards
Code quality: Type-safe, error-handled, production-ready with best practices. All code must follow type-safe patterns, include proper error handling, and meet production-ready standards with adherence to best practices for maintainability and reliability.

### Bonus Feature Implementation
Bonus implementations must be designed for maximum impact. The system should prioritize bonus features that enhance user experience and learning outcomes, including but not limited to auth with background questions, chapter personalization based on user data, and Urdu translation using AI.

## Key Standards
Content must be based on provided course details (modules, weekly breakdown, hardware requirements). Use MDX format for Docusaurus pages with code examples, diagrams, and interactive elements. RAG chatbot must handle general queries and selected text accurately. All bonus implementations should follow the specified requirements for auth, personalization, and translation.

## Constraints and Deployment Requirements
Deploy to GitHub Pages or Vercel. Use free tiers: Qdrant Cloud Free, Neon Serverless Postgres. Incorporate Spec-Kit Plus for spec-driven generation. Create demo video under 90 seconds. Aim for maximum bonus points through comprehensive implementation of all specified features.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and must be followed for all project work. All implementations must adhere to the specified core principles, key standards, and constraints. Any deviation from these principles requires explicit amendment to the constitution with proper justification and approval. All code reviews and project decisions must verify compliance with these principles.
