# AI-Native Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the AI-Native Humanoid Robotics Textbook - a comprehensive educational resource for students, developers, and educators working with humanoid robotics systems.

## Overview

This textbook covers 4 major modules of humanoid robotics development:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 - Robotic Nervous System** - Core ROS2 concepts, nodes, topics, services, actions, and lifecycle management
2. **Module 2: Gazebo & Unity - Digital Twin** - Simulation environments, physics engines, and sensor integration
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac - AI-Robot Brain** - Perception, control, and AI integration with Isaac Sim
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal AI systems for robotics

## Features

- **19 Comprehensive Chapters**: Progressive learning from beginner to intermediate concepts
- **40+ Code Examples**: Practical, runnable examples in Python and C++
- **Simulation Integration**: Complete Gazebo and Isaac Sim examples
- **AI Integration**: Vision-Language-Action systems with neural networks
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practical tasks for each concept
- **Assessment Materials**: Quizzes and practice questions for each chapter

## Target Audience

- Students learning Physical AI and Robotics
- Beginners to intermediate robotics developers
- Educators adopting robotics curriculum
- Researchers and practitioners in humanoid robotics

## Getting Started
